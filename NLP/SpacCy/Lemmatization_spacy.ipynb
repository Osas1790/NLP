    "## Lemmatization SpaCy\n",
    "Lemmatization is a process in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves reducing a word to its base or root form, known as a lemma. Unlike stemming, which simply chops off the ends of words and often results in the creation of non-existent words, lemmatization considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form.\n",
    "Lemmatization is useful in various NLP applications such as text normalization, information retrieval, and text analysis, where it is beneficial to analyze the base form of words rather than their inflected forms. This process helps in achieving more accurate results by consolidating different forms of a word into a single, base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, organizes, organized and organizing are all forms of organize. Here, organize is the lemma. The inflection of a word allows you to express different grammatical categories, like tense (organized vs organize), number (trains vs train), and so on. Lemmatization is necessary because it helps you reduce the inflected forms of a word so that they can be analyzed as a single item. It can also help you normalize the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy puts a lemma_ attribute on the Token class. This attribute has the lemmatized form of the token:"
