    "## Rule-Based Matching Using spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based matching using spaCy is a powerful feature that allows for the identification of specific word sequences or patterns in text, based on a set of predefined rules. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to extract specific types of information from text, like names, dates, or specific keyword patterns. spaCy provides a matcher class which lets you create and apply these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based matching is one of the steps in extracting information from unstructured text. Itâ€™s used to identify and extract tokens and phrases according to patterns (such as lowercase) and grammatical features (such as part of speech).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how rule-based matching works in spaCy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matcher Object: First, you create a Matcher object which is associated with a spaCy nlp object's vocabulary. The Matcher is used to find word sequences that match the provided patterns.\n",
    "- Defining Patterns: Patterns are defined as lists of dictionaries. Each dictionary describes one token and its attributes. For example, you can define a pattern to match a sequence of an adjective followed by a noun.\n",
    "  Attributes: You can use a wide range of token attributes in your patterns. These include the text of the token, its lemma, its part-of-speech tag, its dependency relation tag, and many others.\n",
    "  Adding Patterns to Matcher: After defining your patterns, you add them to the Matcher object. You can give each pattern a unique ID so that you can identify which pattern was matched.\n",
    "- Applying the Matcher: You apply the Matcher to a Doc object (the spaCy representation of a processed text). The Matcher returns the matches, which are tuples containing the match ID, and the start and end indices of the matched span in the Doc.\n",
    "- Handling Matches: You can then iterate over the matches to perform the desired actions, such as extracting information, modifying the text, or using the matches to further analyze the text.\n",
    "  Rule-based matching is highly versatile and can be adapted to a wide range of NLP tasks, from simple keyword matching to complex pattern recognition involving multiple token attributes and logical relations.\n"
